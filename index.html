            <p class = 'information'> Studio Ghibli is a Japanese animation film studio headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan.
                It was founded on June 15, 1985 by Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata.  </p>
            <br>
            <h2> History and Background</h2>
            <p class = 'information'> In the Mid 1980's, Japanese films began a revival and Studio Ghibli was formed. The creators believed that quality anime films
                with a unique vision could be successful. However, there was one issue : in the film industry at the time, anime was looked down upon.

            <div id = 'customLegend'> </div>
            <br> 
            <p class = 'information'> Yet Studio Ghibli was successful in breaking through into the global sphere, landing 6 spots out of 10 in the highest grossing anime films, and paving the way for the anime genre to reach internationally.</p>

            <br>
            <br><br> 

            <p class = 'information'> As they reached worldwide box office success, Studio Ghibli also received many awards. Namely, Miyazaki's Spirited Away won him an Oscar for best animated feature in 2002,
              further launching Studio Ghibli into the spotlight. Moreover, Miyazaki began inspiring directors worldwide. John Lasseter, who was working on the English dub of Spirited Away, was able to connect Studio Ghibli's US distribution rights to Disney.
